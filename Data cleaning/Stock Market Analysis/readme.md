The dataset appears to contain daily stock market data for three companies: Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla. Each row in the dataset represents a day's worth of trading data and includes the following columns:
* Date: The date of the trading day, given in various formats.
* Ticker: The abbreviated name of the company's stock.
* Name: The full name of the company.
* Open: The opening price of the stock on that trading day.
* High: The highest price that the stock reached during that trading day.
* Low: The lowest price that the stock reached during that trading day.
* Close: The closing price of the stock on that trading day.
* Volume: The number of shares of the stock that were traded on that trading day.

The dataset contains some inconsistencies in the formatting of the data, such as different capitalization and spacing of the company names and tickers, and inconsistent date formats. These will need to be cleaned up before the data can be effectively analyzed.
Cleaning the dataset involves several steps to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and reliability. Here are some steps taken to clean this dataset:

1. Remove extra spaces:  In this dataset, some of the row values have extra spaces which can be trimmed to the data consistent across all rows. 
2. Remove blank rows: Blank rows are removed from the dataset to avoid errors in analysis. 
3. Convert data types: The "Date" column is converted to the date format, and the "Volume" column converted to an integer data type. 
4. Correct errors: In some rows, the ticker symbol is misspelled, capitalized or spaced inconsistently. These errors are corrected for consistency. 
5. Remove duplicates: In some rows, the ticker symbol is duplicated, or the company name is repeated with different spacing. We have removed these duplicates to have a cleaner dataset. 
6. Handle missing values: If there are any missing values, we can decide whether to drop those rows or impute the missing values. 

By following these steps, we have cleaned the dataset and prepared it for analysis.
