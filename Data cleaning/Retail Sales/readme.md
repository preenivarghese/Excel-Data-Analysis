This data pertains to the domain of retail and e-commerce. Specifically, it provides information about the transactions of customers purchasing various products from different brands in different locations. The dataset includes variables such as customer ID, brand, product, location, fulfillment, and price, which are commonly used in the retail and e-commerce industry to track sales and customer behavior. This dataset includes 7 variables:

Customer ID - unique identifier for each customer
Contact - name of the customer
Brand - the brand of the product purchased by the customer
Product - the name of the product purchased
Location - the location where the product was purchased
Fulfillment (%) - the percentage of the order fulfilled (0%, 30%, 60%, or 100%)
Price - the price of the product in the format of "dollars,cents"
The dataset includes 20 observations (rows) with missing values in two rows for the "Contact" and "Brand" variables. The "Fulfillment (%)" variable can be converted to a categorical variable with four levels (0%, 30%, 60%, and 100%). The "Price" variable can be converted to a numeric variable. It is possible to identify the most popular brand, product, location, and fulfillment level, as well as the average price of the products purchased. The dataset can also be used to identify if there are any patterns between variables, such as the relationship between the location and brand of the product.

The dataset provides information about 20 customer transactions, including the customer ID, name, brand and product purchased, location of purchase, percentage of order fulfillment, and price of the product.
